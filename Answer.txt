**Title:** Investigating the Impact of Climate Change on Pollen Load and Allergenicity in Urban Pollens

**Background:** Pollen from various plant species has become an increasingly important factor in exacerbating respiratory symptoms such as hay fever, asthma, and other allergic diseases. As climate change continues to alter environmental conditions, there is a growing concern about the potential impact of changing pollen loads and allergenicity on human health.

**Objective:** To examine the effects of rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns on the production, dispersal, and allergenicity of urban pollens in a temperate region.

**Methods:** We conducted a comprehensive study involving the collection and analysis of pollen samples from 15 locations across a metropolitan area over a two-year period (2018-2020). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify pollen species and concentrations, while ELISA assays were employed to measure allergenicity. We also conducted field measurements of temperature, humidity, and wind speed using portable sensors.

**Results:** Our results indicate that the average pollen load in urban areas has increased by 25% over the two-year study period, with a significant correlation between rising temperatures and pollen production (r = 0.85, p < 0.001). Furthermore, our analysis revealed that certain pollen species, such as ragweed and grass, exhibited increased allergenicity under warmer conditions.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the critical need for continued monitoring and research into the impact of climate change on urban pollens and human health. Our findings suggest that warming temperatures may lead to an increase in pollen production, dispersal, and allergenicity, exacerbating respiratory symptoms among vulnerable populations.
